COMPLETED:

- Login Page
	- Authentication + Validation
	- Basic user interface provided by Android Studio template.
	- Communicating with aa PHP script via a Volley 'StringRequest'.
- Forum Access Page
	- A connection to a PHP script stored on Igor has been implemented which pulls a list 
	  of forums and places them in a 'ListView' object.
	- Each item in the ListView is clickable and will take the user to the selected forum.
	- Converted into a fragment.
- Forum page
	- This 'Activity' has been designed to adapt depending on the forum selected allowing
	  us to use one activity for all the forums.
	- A basic user interface has been created which provides the user with a list of 
	  the current messages in their chosen forum as well as an 'EditText' field for the 
	  user to enter a message and a button for them to send it. 
	- Converted into a fragment.
- PHP Scripts
	- The various functions which previously existed in separate scripts have now been 
	  combined into one script.
 	- The current requests have been added with another post parameter which distinguishes 
	  the type of the request, so that they can be directed to the correct function upon 
	  accessing the script. 
- Singleton
	- A singleton implementation of a request handler has been added. This has solved an 
	  error which occurred in the forum page, which was causing the application to close 
	  after a period of time.
	- All the current requests in the pages have been modified in order to take advantage 
	  of the singleton request handler.
- UserInterface 
	- The previous activities have been converted into an array of fragments. 
	- We now have two activities, “MainActivity” and “LoginActivity”. “MainActivity” is 
	  active when the user is logged in and “LoginActivity” is active when the user is 
	  logged out.
	- The navigation menus, including a drop down menu, and a drawer 
  	  for navigating to the different pages of the application have now been implemented 
  	  into the “MainActivity”.

	- (SQL Injection prevention measures were added in the previous version and were 
	  accidentally not noted in the release notes): Added precautions to protect all the 
	  PHP files from SQL injections.

TODO:

	  every time they are needed.
	- Login Screen: Emphasis starts with focus on the email TextBox, so the keyboard
	  appears. Focus at the start needs to be away.
