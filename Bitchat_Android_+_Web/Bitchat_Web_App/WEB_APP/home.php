	This is the landing page for the web app which has been used as a greeting page to greet the users when they
	intially visit the sight. The page uses html5 and the official doctype provided by W3C as this is an industry 
	standard for web pages.

	The page contains a sign in button (link) , which once clicked by the user will send them to the login page in which 
	they shall be able to sign in and go on towards the web app itself. It's quite a basic page however adds to the overall
	user experience and therefore has been added to enhance that experience.
